- 👋 Hi, I’m @1st-wiz-adam
I work for a Veteran owned company that specializes in ServiceNow implementation in State and local government, private / public sector.
I oversee the Pre Sales organization and have my hands on everything pertaining to customer facing services.  
We're building an amazing cloud practice that I'm incredibly proud of and can't wait to start pushing even farther.
What I'm incredibly proud of is our Mission at Veterans Enhanced Technology Solutions.
Our main objective is to help transition Veterans that retire from active service and train them in our various practices that we offer.  
After recieving certifications in the industry and with some experience under their belt they shadow our Senior Architects on projects and we hire them full time.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning, I have an unending thirst to consume as many things as I can.  But I'm a complete noob for programming and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lot's of things right now, in between ServiceNow certification studying and on the side trying to brush up my coding skills.

- GCP - Professional Cloud Architect
- CKA - Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- ServiceNow - Certified Systems Administrator
- CEH - Certified Ethical Hacker
- CHFI - Computer Hacking Forensics Investigator
- CCNA - Cisco Certified Network Administrator
